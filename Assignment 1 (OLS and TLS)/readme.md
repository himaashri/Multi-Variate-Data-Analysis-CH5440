# Assignment 1 - CH5440
## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Total Least Squares (TLS)
### Assumptions:
1. X and Y are linearly related
2. Errors are normally distributed with mean '0'


In OLS, we assume that inputs are perfectly known and output variables contain error. Where as in TLS, we assume that both inputs and outputs contain errors and they are independent with mean '0'. The variances of error in input and output are assumed to be equal. In weighted TLS / WTLS, the variances of error of input and output are assumed to be unqual.
